# `eopkg check` reports broken packages

## Cause

The `eopkg check` command verifies your installed packages by comparing the checksums of files on the disk against their original values from the installation packages.

Some files change during normal Solus usage. Since `eopkg check` doesn't make exceptions for these expected modifications, it may report packages with such files as broken, even when they function correctly.

## Procedure

1. Reinstall the broken package:
   
   ```bash
   sudo eopkg install --reinstall PACKAGE_NAME
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   sudo eopkg install --reinstall firefox
   ```

1. Check if the package works normally.

If the issue persists, or if the package functions normally, the problem is likely due to expected file changes and no further action is required.
